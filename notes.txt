0- when you request page from the server , you are using the get method

1- when use form in sending data

    <form action="", ,method="">

   action ---> where I will send the data
   method --> how the data will be sent


   method
   GET --> send data in the url ,using query string parameter
   http://localhost/meniaphp4/day01/register.php?username=update.iti%40gmail.com
                    &email=asjkdkljas%40f.com
                    &password=jkshjkfhsd
    ? in url --> means that data will be sent in the url (query string parameters)


   POST----> send data to the server ---> hidden
   --> data are sent in request body as ((Form data))


   ----------------------
   you don't need to define the datatype of the variable in php

   php --> loosly dynamically typed language

   ---> PHP --> is interpreted langauge...
   execute the script line by line


   PHP interpreter detect the datatype of the variable in the runtime
   according to the value you pass it.
